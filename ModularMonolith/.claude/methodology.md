# Development Methodology Standards

This document outlines the development methodologies and approaches that should be followed in projects.

## Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

Adopt a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) approach:

- **Clarify Requirements Through Examples:** Collaborate to define expected behaviors using concrete examples in the "Given-When-Then" format. Ensure all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the desired outcomes.
- **Write Tests First:** Before implementing any solution, write clear, human-readable BDD-style tests (e.g., using Gherkin syntax or equivalent). Focus on describing the behavior the system should exhibit, not the implementation details.
- **Implement Incrementally:** Develop code to satisfy the defined tests, starting with the simplest possible implementation.
- **Refactor as needed,** ensuring all tests remain green and the codebase stays clean and maintainable.
- **Iterate and Refine:** Continuously revisit and expand test scenarios as new requirements or edge cases emerge. Use failing tests as guidance for further development and improvement.
- **Document and Communicate:** Keep tests and scenarios well-documented, using them as living specifications for the system's behavior. Foster collaboration and transparency by sharing test scenarios with all team members.

By following this BDD-driven, test-first approach, ensure that solutions are not only robust and reliable but also aligned with user expectations and business goals.

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Follow a test-driven development (TDD) approach by implementing a new feature in three steps:
1.  **Red:** Write a failing unit test for the new feature or function.
2.  **Green:** Write the minimum code necessary to make the test pass.
3.  **Refactor:** Improve the code structure, readability, or efficiency without changing its behavior.

For each step, show the code and briefly explain your reasoning.
