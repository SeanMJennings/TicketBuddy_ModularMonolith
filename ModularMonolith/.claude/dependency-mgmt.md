# Dependency Management Standards

This document outlines standards and practices for effectively managing dependencies in projects.

## Reducing Connascence

1.  **Understand Connascence:** Connascence refers to the degree of interdependence between software modules. The goal is to reduce or eliminate these interdependencies to create more modular and maintainable code.

2.  **Identify Types of Connascence:**
    - **Connascence of Name:** Occurs when multiple components must agree on the name of an entity.
    - **Connascence of Type:** Occurs when multiple components must agree on the type of an entity.
    - **Connascence of Meaning:** Occurs when multiple components must agree on the meaning of a value (e.g., magic numbers).
    - **Connascence of Position:** Occurs when multiple components must agree on the position of an entity (e.g., function parameters).
    - **Connascence of Algorithm:** Occurs when multiple components must agree on the algorithm used.
    - **Connascence of Timing:** Occurs when multiple components must agree on the timing of operations.

3.  **Strategies to Reduce Connascence:**
    - **Encapsulation:** Encapsulate related data and behavior to hide internal details.
    - **Abstraction:** Use interfaces or abstract classes to define contracts.
    - **Loose Coupling:** Design components to interact through well-defined interfaces.
    - **Cohesion:** Ensure components have a single, well-defined purpose.
    - **Refactoring:** Regularly refactor code to eliminate unnecessary connascence.

4.  **Practical Examples:**
    - **Name:** Use meaningful and consistent naming conventions.
    - **Type:** Use type-safe constructs and avoid casting.
    - **Meaning:** Replace magic numbers with named constants or enums.
    - **Position:** Use named parameters or data structures instead of long argument lists.
    - **Algorithm:** Abstract algorithms behind interfaces.
    - **Timing:** Use asynchronous programming patterns.
